## vuetable is only working for Vue 1.x, vuetable-2 is for Vue 2.x
If you're looking for the version that's working with Vue 2.x, please go to [`vuetable-2`](https://github.com/ratiw/vuetable-2) repo. However, I still have no time to work on the documentation. But if you're familiar enough with `vuetable`, it shouldn't be any much different. Look at the [what's changed](https://github.com/ratiw/vuetable-2/blob/master/changes.md) for info on changes from version 1 and the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ratiw/vuetable-2/blob/master/upgrade-guide.md) on how you could upgrade from version 1.

---

## Note on vue-resource version
vuetable internally uses vue-resource to request data from the `api-url`. Prior to v1.5.3, vuetable uses vue-resource v0.7.4 and it retrieves the returned data from `response.data` object. However, since [v0.9.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource/releases/tag/0.9.0) the `response.data` has been renamed to `response.body`. vuetable v1.5.3 onward has been updated to use vue-resource v1.0.2.

This will cause problem with vuetable to display no data because the expected object key is no longer existed and some other related problems as discussed in [#100](https://github.com/ratiw/vue-table/issues/100).

**If you're using vue-resource in your project and the version is 0.9+, please upgrade to use vuetable v1.5.3.**

## Breaking Changes
#### v1.5.0
  - deprecated props
      + `detail-row-callback`: use `row-detail-component` instead

#### v1.3.0
  - deprecated props 
      - `paginateConfig`: use `paginateConfigCallback` instead
      - `detail-row`: use `detail-row-callback` instead


#### v1.2.0
-  `sort-order` option type was changed from `Object` to `Array` to support `multi-sort`, therefore it should be declared as array. [#36](https://github.com/ratiw/vue-table/pull/36)

    ```
    <vuetable 
      //...
      :sort-order="[{ field: 'name', direction: 'asc' }]"
    ></vuetable>
    ```

## What is `vuetable`?
`vuetable` is a Vue.js component that will automatically request (JSON) data
from the server and display them nicely in html table with swappable/extensible
pagination sub-component. You can also add buttons to each row and hook an event
to it

> Please note that all the examples show in here are styling using Semantic UI CSS Framework,
> but `vuetable` should be able to work with any CSS framwork including Twitter's Bootstrap.

You do this:
```html
    <div id="app" class="ui vertical stripe segment">
        <div class="ui container">
            <div id="content" class="ui basic segment">
                <h3 class="ui header">List of Users</h3>
                <vuetable
                    api-url="http://example.app:8000/api/users"
                    table-wrapper="#content"
                    :fields="columns"
                    :item-actions="itemActions"
                ></vuetable>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
```

```javascript
	<script>
	    new Vue({
	        el: '#app',
	        data: {
	            columns: [
	                'name',
	                'nickname',
	                'email',
	                'birthdate',
	                'gender',
	                '__actions'
				],
	            itemActions: [
	                { name: 'view-item', label: '', icon: 'zoom icon', class: 'ui teal button' },
	                { name: 'edit-item', label: '', icon: 'edit icon', class: 'ui orange button'},
	                { name: 'delete-item', label: '', icon: 'delete icon', class: 'ui red button' }
	            ]
	        },
	        methods: {
	            viewProfile: function(id) {
	                console.log('view profile with id:', id)
	            }
	        },
	        events: {
	            'vuetable:action': function(action, data) {
	                console.log('vuetable:action', action, data)
	                if (action == 'view-item') {
	                    this.viewProfile(data.id)
	                }
	            },
	            'vuetable:load-error': function(response) {
	                console.log('Load Error: ', response)
	            }
	        }
        })
	</script>
```

And you get this!
![image](https://i.imgsafe.org/af08442.jpg)

Since I'm mainly using [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com) as my default CSS Framework, all the css
styles in `vuetable` are based on Semantic UI. If you're using Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
css framework, please see [documentation in the Wiki pages](https://github.com/ratiw/vue-table/wiki/Using-%60vuetable%60-with-Twitter's-Bootstrap).

## Usage

### Javascript
```javascript
//vue-table dependencies (vue and vue-resource)
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@1.0.28/dist/vue.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue-resource@1.0.3/dist/vue-resource.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vuetable@1.5.12/dist/vue-table.min.js"></script>
//or
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vuetable@1.5.12/dist/vue-table.js"></script>
```

### Bower

```
$ bower install vuetable
```

### NPM

```
$ npm install vuetable
```

### Vueify version for Browserify and Webpack

Just `import` or `require` like so,

```javascript
//
// firstly, require or import vue and vue-resource
//
var Vue = require('vue');
var VueResource = require('vue-resource');
Vue.use(VueResource);

//
// secondly, require or import Vuetable and optional VuetablePagination component
//
import Vuetable from 'vuetable/src/components/Vuetable.vue';
import VuetablePagination from 'vuetable/src/components/VuetablePagination.vue';
import VuetablePaginationDropdown  from 'vuetable/src/components/VuetablePaginationDropdown.vue';

//
// thirdly, register components to Vue
//
Vue.component('vuetable', Vuetable);
Vue.component('vuetable-pagination', VuetablePagination)
Vue.component('vuetable-pagination-dropdown', VuetablePaginationDropdown)

```
You can combine the second and third steps into one if you like.

You need to explicitly register the pagination components using `Vue.component()` (instead of just declaring them through the `components:` section); otherwise, the pagination component will not work or swappable or extensible. I *guess* this is because it is embedded inside `vuetable` component.

### Direct include

Just import the `vue-table.js` after `vue.js` and `vue-resource.js` library in your page like so.
```html
	<script src="js/vue.js"></script>
	<script src="js/vue-resource.js"></script>
	<script src="js/vue-table.js"></script>
```

Then, reference the vuetable via `<vuetable>` tag as following

```html
	<div id="app">
	    <vuetable
	        api-url="/api/users"
	        :fields="columns"
	    ></vuetable>
    </div>

	<script>
		new Vue({
			el: '#app',
			data: {
				columns: [
					'firstname',
					'lastname',
					'nickname',
					'birthdate',
					'group.name_en',
					'gender',
					'last_login',
					'__actions'
				]
			}
		})
	</script>
```
- `api-url` is the url of the api that `vuetable` should request data from.
The returned data must be in the form of JSON formatted with at least the number of fields
defined in `fields` property.
- `fields` is the fields mapping that will be used to display data in the table.
You can provide only the name of the fields to be used. But if you would like to get
the true power of `vuetable`, you must provide some more information.
Please see [Field Definition](https://github.com/ratiw/vue-table/wiki/Fields-Definition)
section for more detail.

For more detail, please see [documentation in the Wiki pages](https://github.com/ratiw/vue-table/wiki).

<a id="browser_compat"></a>
## Browser Compatability
As I use **Chrome** almost exclusively, it is gaurantee to work on this browser and it SHOULD also work for other **WebKit** based browsers as well. But I can't really gaurantee that since I don't use them regularly. 
 
However, `vuetable` will NOT WORK on **Internet Explorer** (even IE11) due to the use of `<template>` tag inside `<table>` according to [this](https://github.com/ratiw/vue-table/issues/25#issuecomment-220920656). In order to make it work with CSS framework table styling, I have to preserve the use of `<table>` and `<template>` tag inside it.
 
It seems to work just fine in **Microsoft Edge** though. Anyway, if you find that it does not work on any other browser, you can let me know by posting in the [Issues](https://github.com/ratiw/vue-table/issues). Or if you are able to make it work on those browser, please let me know or create a pull request.
 
<a id="contribute"></a>
## Contributions
Any contribution to the code (via pull request would be nice) or any part of the documentation (the Wiki always need some love and care) and any idea and/or suggestion are very welcome.
 
However, please do not feel bad if your pull requests or contributions do not get merged or implemented into `vuetable`. 
 
Your contributions can, not only help make `vuetable` better, but also push it away from what I intend to use it for. I just hope that you find it useful for your use or learn something useful from its source code. But remember, you can always fork it to make it work the way you want.

### Building

Run `npm install`

Then make sure, you have installed browserify:

```
# npm install browserify -g
```

You might need root access for running the above command.

Then you can simply run the build script included in the root folder:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

This will compile the vue components in the `src` directory to one file in the `dist` folder.

You might want to get a minified version, in this case run this:

```
$ ./build.sh production
```

For developement it's useful when it's not needed to recompile manually each time you make a change. If you want this convenience first install watchify globally:

```
# npm install watchify -g
```

then run

```
$ ./build.sh watch
```

Now each time you make a change, the source will be recompiled automatically.
